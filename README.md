Hi :)

I'm Stringatto, and I *love* technology. It's what wakes me up in the morning ngl hehehehe. Anyway this github is for all of my channel/hobby projects.
Probably gonna put a fuck ton of shit here lmao.
Anyway, I like AI, robotics, video editing, physics, engineering, math, the whole 9 yards of tech really.

Not really looking to collab on anything atm, so don't bother asking.

If you want to see more of my stuff I have a YouTube channel called "Stringatto", find it yourself.
